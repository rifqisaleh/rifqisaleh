# ✈️ Muhammad Rifqi Saleh

**Commercial First Officer | Junior Backend Developer**

Welcome! I’m Rifqi — a licensed First Officer with over 400 hours of flying experience, including more than 200 hours on jet aircraft. I’ve flown both scheduled and charter operations in Indonesia using the BAe 146. While aviation remains my core passion, I’ve also transitioned into backend development, where I apply the same discipline and attention to detail from the cockpit to my code.

## 🧭 Career Summary

I started my aviation career in 2017 and flew until 2020 with two domestic airlines. My experience includes high-pressure line operations, charter flights for VIPs, and adherence to strict operational protocols. Since 2024, I’ve been training in full-stack software engineering program through structured, project-based learning at [RevoU](https://revou.co/), where I’ve built and contributed to full-stack applications and RESTful APIs.

My dual-track career reflects my adaptability and passion for learning. I am currently looking to re-enter aviation as a Second Officer, while also open to freelance backend development opportunities that allow me to grow technically and work collaboratively.
